        <p className="text-3xl">What Are The Best Crypto Trading Bots</p>
        <p className="text-xl pt-8 ml-10">
          Modern crypto trading bots do more than trade crypto â€“ being based on
          artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other smart
          technologies means they can collect big data crypto market information
          in real-time using APIs. They then analyze this information using
          predefined trading strategies to derive useful and actionable metrics
          or conclusions called trading signals.
          <br />
          The analysis is made with the target of predicting future crypto
          prices, say for Bitcoin and other coins, and the correctness or
          exactness of the prediction is what matters. The closer the price is
          to prediction, the better the bot and crypto bot trading, as that
          amplifies profits.
          <br />
          Once the future price is predicted, they then place trading buy and
          sell orders in actual crypto markets. And since most markets complete
          the limit and other types of orders automatically, these buy and sell
          orders are completed. Hence, they make a profit or loss.
          <br />
          The best crypto trading bots pull information from multiple social
          sources, news sites, crypto market makers, and many other sources.
          This is why they employ AI and machine learning to decipher what news
          is making a social impact and which will probably highly influence
          market prices. Bots can be bought separately as a single software or
          integrated into crypto exchanges.
          <br />
          However, there is no perfect crypto trading bot despite them costing
          up to millions of dollars. They still make losses, although the
          intention is to limit the losses. Plus, the best crypto trading bots
          are used alongside human intervention.
